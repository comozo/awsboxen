* Tweak how .awsbox.json declarations are upgraded in a Boxen, making it
  possible to disable this feature by setting Boxen.AWSBox = null;
* Add the notion of awsboxen-provided pre-processing functions, using
  syntax { "Fn::AWSBoxen::<funcname>" : <args> }.
  * The first function is "UserDataFiles", which turns a JSON description
    of that config files to write into a CloudInit UserData script that
    will write those files at startup.


0.3.0 - 2013-06-25
==================

* Allow '-D param=value' syntax for defining template parameter values.
* Read 'awsboxen.json' in addition to '.awsboxen.json'.
* Refuse to run if there are uncommitted changs; --ignore-uncommitted to force.
* Give meaningful names to the snapshots associated with each AMI, so that
  they're easier to find again later.
