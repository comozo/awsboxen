0.5.2 - 2013-11-01
==================

* Update dependencies to latest versions.


0.5.1 - 2013-09-19
==================

* Let BuildScript Boxen specify multiple scripts to run, by giving the list
  in "BuildScripts" property.  This makes it easier to share common logic
  between different Boxen.
* Only rebuild BuildScript-based AMIs when the actual script has changed, not
  when some other random part of the repo has changed.
* Let BuildScript Boxen refer to template parameters in their build scripts.
  This is convenience but should be used sparingly, as it means you have to
  build a separate AMI whenever those params change.
* Add `awsboxen validate` command to submit your CloudFormation template
  to the server for validation.


0.5.0 - 2013-08-12
==================

* Use "--config=FILE" to specify a particular awsboxen config to use,
  overriding the defaul .awsboxen.json and friends.
* Implement loading of template parameters from files, including optional
  on-the-fly decryption via gpg.
* Print stack events to the console while waiting for it to deploy.  This
  gives a much better picture of its progress, and also earlier information
  on any errors that occur.
* Add "awsboxen info <stack-name> <resource-name>" to get more detailed info
  on a particular stack resource.


0.4.0 - 2013-07-01
==================

* Rename "lib/projinfo.js" to "lib/loadTemplate.js", since that's really
  the only thing that it does.
* Resolve uses of {'Ref'} and {'Fn::FindInMap'} in Boxen declarations.
  This is helpful if you need to use a different AMI in different regions.
* Allow specifying --aws-id, --aws-secret and --aws-region on the command line.
* Tweak how .awsbox.json declarations are upgraded into a Boxen, making it
  possible to disable this feature by setting Boxen.AWSBox = null;


0.3.0 - 2013-06-25
==================

* Allow '-D param=value' syntax for defining template parameter values.
* Read 'awsboxen.json' in addition to '.awsboxen.json'.
* Refuse to run if there are uncommitted changs; --ignore-uncommitted to force.
* Give meaningful names to the snapshots associated with each AMI, so that
  they're easier to find again later.
