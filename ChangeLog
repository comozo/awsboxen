=======

* Rename "lib/projinfo.js" to "lib/loadTemplate.js", since that's really
  the only thing that it does.
* Resolve uses of {'Ref'} and {'Fn::FindInMap'} in Boxen declarations.
  This is helpful if you need to use a different AMI in different regions.
* Allow specifying --aws-id, --aws-secret and --aws-region on the command line.
* Tweak how .awsbox.json declarations are upgraded into a Boxen, making it
  possible to disable this feature by setting Boxen.AWSBox = null;


0.3.0 - 2013-06-25
==================

* Allow '-D param=value' syntax for defining template parameter values.
* Read 'awsboxen.json' in addition to '.awsboxen.json'.
* Refuse to run if there are uncommitted changs; --ignore-uncommitted to force.
* Give meaningful names to the snapshots associated with each AMI, so that
  they're easier to find again later.
